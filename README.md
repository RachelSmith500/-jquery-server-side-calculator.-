# JQuery Server Side Calculator 

## Description

I create a user interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and the select type of mathematical operation. When the submit (`=` button) is clicked, the input is captured, bundled up in an object, and sent to the server via a POST. There is also a clear button that clears all user input fields. 

This app is leveraging the server. The server is temporarily storing the equations made by the users, appending those equations to the DOM, and then appending the most recent answer to the DOM. 

## Prerequisites

You will need to install node.js on your computer.
